    "The new Technology that is being introduced must be reviewed by Enterprise Architecture (EAC) in accordance with architecture review processes, prior the use of the Technology at Maybank.\n\nThe Standard Class in the Technology Catalogue explains the technology preference for Maybank Group\n20-Feb-24\n8\nRestricted\nEach technology in the Technology Catalogue are assigned a Standard Class. This classification indicates the level of preference as follows :\n\tStandard Class\tDefinition\tStandard Class State Reference\n\tEmerging\tAvailable for limited use in new implementations\tEncouraged to use; with justification, as these are comparatively newer or open-source technology, which are not mature in Maybank ecosystem (not time-tested)\n\tMainstream\tStrongly recommended for new implementations\tMost preferable with no condition, as these technology/version are fully supported by the vendor or by the open-source community; and also the technology have high level of maturity in Maybank ecosystem (time-tested)\n\tContainment\tInstalled and still requiring support\tShould be avoided for new implementation unless a very strong justification provided, as these are nearing the end-of-life OR, the technology is not preferred for general use\n\tRetirement\tInstalled and scheduled for retirement\tShould be avoided at all cost for new implementation, as these technology/version are obsolete.  \n\nIn Summary\nStandard Class is the base indicator whether a technology is preferred or to be avoided.\nTechnology designated under Mainstream is preferred for new implementation.\nTechnology designated under Retirement must be avoided for new implementation.\nTechnologies under Emerging or Containment must obtain EA approval for new implementation.\n\nThe Technology Catalogue identifies the technology blocks, and End of Support of each technology\n20-Feb-24\n9\nRestricted\nTechnology Blocks\n\nCurrently we have identified 10 technology blocks / category in general:\n\tTechnology Block\tDescription\tExample\n\tSecurity\tSoftware and/or hardware that supports security functions.\tThreat Intelligent, LDAP, Web Application Firewall, APT, HSM\n\tSupport Platform\tFamily of servers that include hardware, operating system and operating system support software \tOperating System, Virtual Machine, Server Software, SCCM\n\tSoftware Engineering\tRefers to application framework, programming languages, etc.\tProgramming Languages, Framework, IDE tools\n\tDatabase & Storage\tRefers to data storage, backup server, data replication and database management systems such as Oracle, DB2, EMC etc.\tStorage Arrays, Database Management, Backup, Data Replication\n\tContent Management\tRefer to process for collection, delivery, retrieval, governance and overall management of information.\tBusiness Process Management, Reporting & Analysis, Presentation & Reporting\n\tNetwork\tRefer to network support devices such as routers, switches, etc.\tRouter, Switches, Load Balancer, \n\tApplication Platform\tRefer to the container running the actual application platforms that enable them to work\tApplication Server, Portal Server\n\tIntegration & Middleware\tSoftware or hardware that manages disparate applications across the heterogeneous computing platforms.

Technology Catalogue provides an indicator when  a product is at the end of its useful life (from the vendor point of view), or when a vendor stops selling, or rework to sustain it.\nTechnology that are in used after end of support will normally incur a higher overhead for maintenance. \n\nFAQ: Technology Obsolescence Risk\nTechnology obsolescence is defined as when a technology is no longer supported by a product vendor, or for open source, when the community supporting the product is not longer active (GSAM definition)\n\nQ: Why GSAM marked the application or the technology the obsolescence risk before it is the end of extended support?\nA: GSAM takes a holistic view of obsolescence risk on the architecture to provide a strategic view of the application lifecycle management. It takes a proactive approach to ensure obsolescence risk to an application is identified upfront to create awareness among stakeholders and to enable stakeholders to plan accordingly, i.e. there is sufficient time to budget, plan for the upgrade, etc"
